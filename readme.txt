This is a straight forward Plugin that does not require the use of any shortcodes or widgets. Simply head for Settings > Let It Snow and configure your snow flurry! This plugin makes use of Jason Brown's brilliant jQuery plugin [Snowfall](http://loktar00.github.io/JQuery-Snowfall/), all credit for the snow effect must go to Jason! This is being distributed as a FREE plugin from Winking Frog Studios, we hope you all have a wonderful Christmas in 2014.

There is a really good chance this plugin will work with earlier versions of WordPress, as it doesn't use anything only found in more recent releases.
